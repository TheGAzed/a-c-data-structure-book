\chapter*{Preface}

This book describes the process of designing and implementing a personal data structure library in the C programming language. Each implementation is centered around two types of implementations - an infinitely expandable structure able to hold any amount of elements, and a finite one able to hold only a certain maximum amount.

The goal of this work is not to be the go-to data structure book for C, on the contrary, the name is meant to represent an affordable book for the public which doesn't take itself seriously.

The book will be divided into parts classifying all structures into categories of chapters. Each chapter will explain the process of creating said structure and the code used to make it. 

Since the code is in C a decent understanding of the programming language is required, that primarily includes - structures (struct), pointers, memory allocation, and last but certainly not least - function pointers.

All the source code will be available at github under the {\texttt{Unlicense License}}.

If I have to put a disclaimer I just want to clarify that the reason why some paragraphs may be written like this is because the book was created using \LaTeX in Visual Studio Code and I hate seeing {\texttt{Overfull \textbackslash hbox}} highlights.
