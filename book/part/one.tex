\part{Restricted sequential data structures} \label{p:one}
\noindent The name of the first part comes from the inability to find a categoric name for only stacks, queues and deques. 
Online sources categorize those as linear dynamic data structures, the problem is... linked lists are also part of this category. 
I want to put list implementations into a separate book part, thus I hereby coin the term {\normalfont\texttt{Restricted sequential data structures}} as a subcategory ob dynamic linear data structures.
I know nobody will take this declaration seriously, but for the sake of this book please bear with it.
